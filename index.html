        <p>
          Daniel Dumile, born January 9, 1971, better known by several stage
          names, most notably MF Doom (stylized as MF DOOM), is a British
          rapper, songwriter, and record producer best known for his "super
          villain" stage persona and rhyme-dense, humorous lyrical style. MF
          Doom's mask, similar to that of Russell Crowe's titular character from
          the film Gladiator, is depicted rapping on the cover of the 1999 album
          Operation: Doomsday. MF Doom has appeared in several collaborative
          projects such as Madvillain (with Madlib), Danger Doom (with Danger
          Mouse), Doomstarks (with Ghostface Killah), JJ Doom (with Jneiro
          Jarel), NehruvianDoom (with Bishop Nehru), and Czarface Meets Metal
          Face (with Czarface).
